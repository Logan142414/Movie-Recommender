        "\n",
        "-The project uses the **MovieLens 32M dataset**, a large-scale collection of over 32 million movie ratings and 2 million tag applications applied to 87,000+ movies by 200,000+ users.  \n",
        "This dataset, released in May 2024, is maintained by [GroupLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).\n",
        "\n",
        "-Because of its size, the dataset is **not stored directly in this repository**.  \n",
        "Instead, the notebook includes code that automatically **downloads and extracts** the dataset on first run.\n",
        "\n",
        "-You have two options to access the data:\n",
        "\n",
        "**-Option 1 – Automatic (Recommended)**  \n",
        "No setup required. The notebook will download and extract the MovieLens 32M dataset automatically from the official GroupLens source the first time you run it.\n",
        "\n",
        "**-Option 2 – Manual Upload**  \n",
        "1. Visit [https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/32m/](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/32m/).  \n",
        "2. Download the file ml-32m.zip.  \n",

        "\n",

        "+1.0 → perfect positive correlation (they rate movies the same way relative to each other).\n",
        "\n",
        "0.0 → no correlation (random relationship).\n",
        "\n",
        "-1.0 → perfect negative correlation (they always disagree).\n",
        "\n",
        "NaN → not enough variation (e.g., both rated the same movie with the same score → no variance to compare).\n",
        "\n",
        "-Keep only the top 10 most similar users (“neighbors”) to the target user.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Recommend new movies\n",
        "\n",
        "-Look at movies that neighbors rated highly (e.g., 4–5 stars).\n",
        "\n",
        "-Exclude any that the target user has already rated.\n",
        "\n",
        "**-Only include movies rated by at least 4 neighbors to ensure reliability.\n",
